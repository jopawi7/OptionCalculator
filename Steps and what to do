A. General Objective
  Build an Option Calculator that replicates the one linked in the instructions, with the additional requirements and constraints below.
 
B. Functional Content (what the program must handle)
  B1. Support European and American options (as in the original calculator).
  B2. Add two additional option types, chosen from:
     • Asian
     • Binary
     • Barrier
  B3. When no closed-form formula exists, use the Black–Scholes model for the evolution of the underlying asset price.
  B4. For Monte Carlo simulations:
     • The number of simulations must be a model parameter.
     • The time step must also be a model parameter.
  B5. For all other input variables, use the same ones provided in the web version of the Option Calculator.
   
C. Input / Output Management
  C1. Inputs:
    All input parameters — including financial data, Monte Carlo settings, and configuration variables — must always be read from a file.
  C2. Default output:
    Output values should be printed to the console by default.
  C3. Optional output:
    It must be possible to write the results to another file instead of (or in addition to) the console.
 
D. Implementation Requirements
  D1. Program organization:
    The code should be divided into modules, according to a logical subdivision of tasks.
  D2. Graphics:
    No graphical output is required.
    The presence or absence of graphics does not affect grading.
